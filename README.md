# Centralized License Service

A multi-tenant License Service for managing licenses and entitlements across multiple brands in the group.one ecosystem.

## Overview

This service acts as the single source of truth for licenses and entitlements across brands like WP Rocket, Imagify, RankMath, BackWPup, RocketCDN, WP.one, etc. It provides a centralized API for brand systems to provision and manage licenses, while allowing end-user products to activate and validate their licenses.

## Features

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple brands with isolated data
- **License Management**: Create and manage license keys and licenses
- **Seat Management**: Track and enforce license seat limits
- **License Lifecycle**: Full lifecycle management (create, renew, suspend, resume, cancel)
- **License Activation**: End-user products can activate licenses for specific instances
- **License Status Checking**: Public endpoints for license validation and entitlement checking
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs for brand systems and end-user products
- **UUID-based Routing**: Secure and scalable API design
- **Brand Authentication**: Bearer token authentication for brand-facing operations

## API Documentation

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8002/api/v1
```

### Authentication

#### Brand Authentication (Required for brand-facing operations)
Brand-facing operations require authentication using the brand's API key:
```
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
```

The API key is automatically generated when a brand is created and can be found in the `brands` table.

#### Public Endpoints (No authentication required)
End-user product endpoints and license status checking endpoints are public and do not require authentication.

### Endpoints

#### License Key Management (Brand-facing - Requires Authentication)

**Create License Key**
```bash
POST /license-keys
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "customer_email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Get License Key**
```bash
GET /license-keys/{uuid}
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
```

#### License Management (Brand-facing - Requires Authentication)

**Create License**
```bash

Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "license_key_uuid": "license-key-uuid",
    "product_uuid": "product-uuid",
    "expires_at": "2026-12-31",
    "max_seats": 5
}
```

**Get License**
```bash
GET /licenses/{uuid}
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
```

#### License Lifecycle Management (Brand-facing - Requires Authentication)

**Renew License**
```bash
PATCH /licenses/{uuid}/renew
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "days": 180
}
```

**Suspend License**
```bash
PATCH /licenses/{uuid}/suspend
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Resume License**
```bash
PATCH /licenses/{uuid}/resume
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Cancel License**
```bash
PATCH /licenses/{uuid}/cancel
Authorization: Bearer {brand-api-key}
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### License Activation (End-User Products - Public)

**Activate License**
```bash
POST /licenses/{uuid}/activate
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "instance_id": "site-123",
    "instance_type": "wordpress",
    "instance_url": "https://example.com",
    "machine_id": "machine-456"
}
```
